# ThreadWise UI

React + Vite starter with Tailwind CSS preconfigured.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server starts on `http://localhost:5173` by default.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start Vite dev server with hot module replacement
- `npm run build` – create a production build in `dist`
- `npm run preview` – locally preview the production build
- `npm run lint` – run ESLint with the default configuration

## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind is wired through `postcss.config.js` and `tailwind.config.js`. Edit `tailwind.config.js` to customize design tokens and utility classes.
